# Project C1: *se1-bestellsystem*

Project of a simple order processing system for the *Software Engineering-I*
course.

Class *Customer* has attributes:

- *id* (long) to identify a *Customer*,

- *lastName* and *firstName* (String) for the *Customer* name and

- contacts as List of contacts (String), e.g. *email*, *phone number*.

Classes *Order* and *Article* have also an *id* and other attributes.

**Cardinalities (dimensions)** describe whether *one* (strict: `1` or
optional: `0..1`) or *many* (zero or more: `*` or at-least one: `1..*`)
objects of one side of a relation may exist. If nothing is specified,
strict `1` is assumed.

One *Customer* may have many *Orders* - the cardinality of this relation
is: `[ 1 : * ]` (`1` with *Customer* and `*` with *Order*). In reverse
direction it reads: each *Order* is assigned exactly one *Customer*.

The relation between *Order* and *OrderItem* is: `[ 1 : 1..* ]`.
It reads: each *Order* has at least one (one or more, but at least one)
*OrderItem*. In reverse, each *OrderItem* is assigned to exactly one
*Order*.

The relation between *OrderItem* and *Article* is: `[ * : 1 ]`.
It reads: each *OrderItem* refers to exactly one *Article*. In reverse,
*Articles* may be referred to by many *OrderItems*.

**Relationships** between classes describe how classes (more precisely: their objects)
relate to one other.

- **Aggregation (white Diamond)** expresses a logical association (*"ownership"*)
    of one class to another. *Orders* are always assigned to *Customers*.
    *Orders* are not included in *Customer* objects. An *Order* cannot exist without
    the owning *Customer*.

    The *Aggregation* relationship is implemented by a reference in the "*owned*"
    class to the *"owning"* class. Class *Customer* has no information about the
    *Orders* the *Customer* owns. But each *Order* has a reference to their owning
    *Customer*.

- **Composition (black Diamond)** expresses a *"part-of"* relation. Elements of
    one class are part of another. Class *Order* contains a list of *OrderItems*.

    Since class *Order* contains *OrderItems*, this information is not included
    in *OrderItem*. Just considering an *OrderItem*, the *Order* it belongs to cannot
    be determined. Inclusion implies that *OrderItems* cannot exist without the
    containing *Order*. *OrderItem* objects are managed by the including class
    and may not need identifiers (no *id* attribute).

- **Association** (a line without diamond) expresses any other relation between
    classes that is not *"ownership"* or *"part_of"* such as between *OrderItem*
    and *Article*. An *Article* may exist without an *OrderItem*.

## 3. Check Project into Own Remote Repository

Create a new project with name: *"se1-bestellsystem"* in your
[*BHT GitLab*](https://gitlab.bht-berlin.de/)
or other repository, e.g. at [*GitHub*](https://github.com/).


### 3.1 Check for *SSH-Keys* in Remote Repository

Make sure, you have a `public ssh key` registered in your *Git* account.

You find registered public keys in

- *GitLab* at section: [*SSH Keys*](https://gitlab.bht-berlin.de/-/user_settings/ssh_keys)
  - reached through: `<personal> -> User Settings -> SSH Keys` (start at small
    sidebar icon in the upper left).

- *GitHub* at section: [*SSH Keys*](https://github.com/settings/keys)
  - reached through: `<personal> -> Settings -> SSH Keys`.


### 3.2 Check for *SSH-Keys* on your Laptop

Check you have a public/private SSH key pair installed in your $HOME
directory:

```sh
cd $HOME                            # change to $HOME directory
ls -la                              # list content
```

A directory `.ssh` should appear among other entries:

```
total 159
drwxr-xr-x 1     0 Jun  1 18:47 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1     0 Mar 22 11:50 ../
...
drwxr-xr-x 1     0 Mar 17 19:42 .ssh/       <-- directory with SSH key pairs
```

If you don't have `.ssh` in $HOME, create with the following command using the default
settings (don't put a password on your keys):

```sh
ssh-keygen                          # create SSH keys in '.ssh' directory
```

Show content:

```sh
ls -la .ssh                         # list content of '.ssh' directory
```
```
total 40
drwxr-xr-x 1    0 Mar 17 19:42 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1    0 Jun  1 18:47 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 1679 Mar 17 19:42 id_rsa       <-- file with private key
-rw-r--r-- 1  415 Mar 17 19:42 id_rsa.pub   <-- file with public key
```

Show the content of the public key file `id_rsa.pub` (default name):

```sh
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub                 # show content of public key file
```
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDsYvrIXtdlPGjByzFbB2S/AgjFzaWCBQ+cot7rrXDLMWJHH+uyWNbh0QpXGtTPm43XXH6hx004ew3cv52k5atqeJgkKGPLb3Zzp9Kg1yVQg5u2dntuzPW8ghwLKdVkHPoYLSLrj/ivYXYqrqsahJ0Nt0QSgjNQ/BUJvLaWXpXGP2EKT5f2S5un61Sdw0u37z5n/KnGOUtwAcG+cJn7b/5BP7REC+HI6v8/RLtCN36vN7Mz+nUio2btFIFmkxSjnxj8G/y4318V9mf7p1W7jTZ9Pcc2ku41yz9JNBl/E4YyVJvEjTO/4yEJ/4AYSDnkL2g57chRhliw5pmVtzONCwX7 sven.graupner@beuth-hochschule.de
```

Show the content of the private key file `id_rsa` (default name):

```sh
cat .ssh/id_rsa                     # show content of private key file
```

Output should of the private key file `id_rsa` should always stay protected on
your laptop. Its possession in combination with the public key enables anybody
to act on your behalf.


### 3.3 Add Remote (Repository)

Obtain the *ssh*-repository URL from the GitLab project site, e.g.
`git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de:<your-id>/se1.bestellsystem.git`
and register the name `origin` as new remote repository:

```sh
# register the remote repository URL under the name 'origin'
# make sure to replace the '<...>' with your account id
git remote add origin git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de:<...>/se1.bestellsystem.git

# show the new remote URL
git remote -v
```

The new URL is registered under name `origin`.

```
origin  git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de/se1-bestellsystem.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de/se1-bestellsystem.git (push)
se1-patch-repository    https://github.com/sgra64/se1-bestellsystem.git (fetch)
se1-patch-repository    https://github.com/sgra64/se1-bestellsystem.git (push)
```

Show the new remote URL in file `.git/config`:

```
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = false
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        ignorecase = true
[remote "origin"]               <-- new remote URL
        url = git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de/se1-bestellsystem.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```


### 3.4 Push and Push Conflicts

The local `main` branch can now be pushed to the corresponding remote branch
`origin main`.

The two branches:

- the local `main` branch and the

- corresponding remote branch `origin main`

will be linked as "*tracking branch*" and "*tracked branch*".
The local branch `main` will track the remote branch `origin main`.


```sh
git push --set-upstream origin main     # push branch 'main' to remote 'origin'

# or as short version:
git push -u origin main                 # short for pushing the local branch 'main'
```

If the *push* fails with an error:

```
$ git push

 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@gitlab.bht-berlin.de/se1-bestellsystem.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first merge the remote changes (e.g.,
hint: 'git pull') before pushing again.
```

the branch in the remote repository has commits that are not yet in the local
branch.

Unlike *GitHub*, *GitLab* does not create a new repository *empty*. It creates
an initial commit causing a
[*Push Conflict*](https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Git/Resolving_Push_Conflicts).

1. Branches pushed to remote repositories are meant to be shared with other developers.
    Hence, other developers can pull and commit to those branches as well.
    **Remote branches can grow without your awareness**.

1. ***Git* synchronizes commit chains,** which means it will not allow commits
    being pushed **(Push Conflict)** that are not based on the latest commit
    on the remote branch.

1. Git does **not automatically synchronize branches**.
    Hence, before you can push your commits, you must **pull**
    (pull: fetch + merge) commits others have made on the remote branch.

1. **Git pull will merge commits** others have made into your work creating
    a new (merge-) commit that is now the latest commit of the chain can
    **can be pushed** -- unless someone else has made further commits in the
    mean time, then the process repeats.

Resolve the push conflict by *pulling* missing commits from the remote branch:

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin main     # push branch 'main' to remote 'origin'

# or as short version:
git push -u origin main                 # short for pushing the local branch 'main'
```


### 3.5 Local "*tracking*" Branch

With the push of the `main` branch to the remote, the local branch `main` has
become a local "*tracking*" branch of the remote branch, which means further
*pulls* will refer to the remote ("*tracked*") branch.

```sh
git branch -avv                         # show all remote and local tracking branches
```
```
* main                        7bc247f [origin/main] add README.md
  remotes/origin/main         7bc247f add README.md
```

Label `[origin/main]` (in blue color) shows the association of the local
`main` branch with the remote *"tracked"* branch `origin/main`.

Further commands will refer to the associated remote tracked branch:

```sh
# both commands refer to the associated remote "tracked" branch
git pull
pit push
```
